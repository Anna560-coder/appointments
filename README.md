I have developed three distinct projects, each designed to showcase different aspects of authentication and data management. 
The first project is for JWT-based Authentication (JWT-Authentication File), implementing token-based security mechanisms. 
The second project focuses on traditional MVC Authentication (Authentication File), demonstrating how to manage user sessions in a web application.
Lastly, the third project handles MVC-based CRUD operations (Crud-Operations File), providing a full set of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
Both the MVC Authentication and CRUD Operations projects share a common database to ensure seamless data flow and consistency. 
Please ensure that each file is run separately to maintain proper isolation and functionality.
